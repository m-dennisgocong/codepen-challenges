- November 2020 - Design Decades 
    
    The challenges are inspired by the evolution of web interface design from the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. I decided to recreate Google's old homepage.

    1. The 1980s - since Google launched in 1998, I created a Google not found page <a href="https://codepen.io/dennisgocong/full/OJEOmOL"> View Here! </a>

    2. The 1990s - Google 1998 Homepage <a href="https://codepen.io/dennisgocong/full/WNyzxJx"> View Here! </a>

    3. The 2000s - Google 2000 Homepage <a href="https://codepen.io/dennisgocong/full/OJEEjZM"> View Here! </a>
